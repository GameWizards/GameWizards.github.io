            <h3>What is <i>Anttris</i>?</h3>
            <p>Anttris is a cross-platform puzzle solving game. Players
            work to match colored blocks and remove to reveal the center of the block. Once
            all blocks have been removed, the puzzle is solved and the game is won!</p>
            <p>So what makes Anttris different from another Bejeweled&trade; clone? Where is
            the novelty? Where is the challenge? Anttris plays sort of like a mix of Mojang&trade;
            and Bejeweled&trade;, requiring players find the pre-matched <b>paired blocks</b> in order to remove
            them from the puzzle. Red blocks are always matched to red blocks, and blue to blue.
            Each block, however, only has one valid pair that must be sought and found. Once both
            blocks in the pair have been selected, the pair will be removed and the player can
            continue to try and work their way down to the center. Only one each outer layer of
            the cube has been removed can players begin to select blocks from the next layer.</p>
            <p>Already we have a game that involved players frantically spinning around a cube
            and trying to find the pair for a block. Besides the regular <b>pair blocks</b> that must
            be removed, the block will also come with <b>wild blocks</b>. These blocks act like
            wild cards in card games, being able to be matched to any other block of the same
            color &mdash; for the large price of a cut of their current score!</p>
            <p>More information about game rules can be found on the <a href="gameRules.html">Game Rules</a> 
            page!</p>
            
            <h3>What devices can I run Anttris on?</h3>
            <p>Special care was taken to ensure that Anttris could be run on any device from a
            computer to a hand-held smartphone device. What's even cooler is that all multiplayer
            capabilities are available to you regardless of what device you're currently running
            on. This means you can play on your tablet while your friend plays on their PC and
            still go head to head!</p>
