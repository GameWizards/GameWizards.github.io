            <p>Chris, you should look at this part and make sure it's right</p>
            <h3>Basic Concepts &amp; Rules</h3>
            <p>In order to solve a puzzle in Anttris, players must clear away all blocks and
            reach the center block. To clear blocks, players match like-colored blocks
            together. The tricky part is that each colored <b>paired block</b> has exactly
            one other block it's paired with and can be cleared with. So even if there are
            lots of <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">red blocks</span>, each 
            <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">red block</span> only has one
            other <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">red block</span> they can 
            be matched against! A <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">red block
            </span> will never be matched to another color, like a
            <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">blue block</span>.</p>
            <p>Blocks can only be paired and matched with other blocks from the same
            <i>layer</i>, meaning blocks on the very outside of the cube must be matched
            with other blocks that are also on the outside. As blocks are removed, players
            can only interact with blocks that are on the top-most <i>layer</i>. Only once
            all the blocks from the <i>layer</i> have been cleared can the player begin to
            remove blocks from beneath.</p>
            
            <h3>Lasers and Wild Blocks</h3>
            <p>In addition to the regular <b>paired blocks</b>, Anttris features special
            blocks called <b>lasers</b> and <b>wild blocks</b>. Any blocks between paired
            <b>laser blocks</b> are wild blocks.</p>
            <p><b>Wild blocks</b> work like wild cards in card games &mdash; a <b>wild
            block</b> can be paired with any other block on the current <i>layer</i> that is
            the same color. When <b>paired blocks</b> are paired with <b>wild blocks</b>,
            the block pair will be removed from the puzzle as if the player found the pair
            on their own.</p>
            <p>Using the <b>wild blocks</b> can drastically increase the time it takes to
            solve a puzzle. Be careful, though, as using <b>wild blocks</b> costs players
            a large penalty to their score! Any left over <b>wild blocks</b> when a layer is
            cleared are used to give the player a bonus to their score!</p>
